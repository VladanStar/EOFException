# EOFException
Stopping reading the input file is done by dropping the EOFException when the end of the file is reached. In the previous example, the DataOutputStream object was created for the temp.dat file in lines 6-7. Student names and grades are written to a file in lines 10-15. Line 18 closes the output stream- DataInputStream object for the same file in lines 21-22- Student names and their grades are loaded back from the file and displayed on the console in lines 25-27.
